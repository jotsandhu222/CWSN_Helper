This script is helpful for CWSN to learn language and also it can translate normal written text to sign language(like a translator).

First Things!!
1.make a folder named "sign_images" and paste all the jpg images to it.
2.make sure that the python file and folder should be in the same directory.
3.i recommend a keyboard with letters 3D fixed on it(or you can use braile). i did not had this type of keyboard so i made it myself, it was easy and budget friendly as i only 
have to make letters with paper and fix it with the glu on the keys.

What this script do!!

1.this program has 3 modes which can be selected with F1,F2 and F3 respectively.
i) game mode- you will see random pics on the screen and it will also speak the letter and you have to select the correct key from keyboard by feeling the 3D letters. this mode will make it a bit fun to learn letters
ii) basic mode- you will press a key on the keyboard and the program will show you picture of the letter with spoken feedback. this mode will introduce children with the letters and their shape 
iii) advance mode- this mode will ask you to enter any kind of words(can be a story from a book or a news from a webpage) and the program will show everything in sign language, making it a translator for CWSN and also
parents can paste anything from the internet and the program will do the rest for the student.

more things can be added to this, it is just a basic python script.
